# Report

Report Portal is developed using MERN for quicker and easier creation of different types of Pest reports. Portal is designed to make pest control management more efficient and effective for businesses and their clients. The reports are created using a user-friendly interface with predefined report template that allows Operator/Supervisor to input information such as the type of pest problem, the severity of the infestation, location with image and the recommended treatment plan.

Once the report is submitted, back office team gets notification fo new report. He/She can download/edit/approve/reject that report. And also has the option to upload the quotation file, which can be sent to the client via email along with the report. Clients can access the report at any time, allowing them to review the recommended treatment plan and take any necessary actions.
